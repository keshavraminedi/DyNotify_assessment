# DyNotify_assessment
Please intall the following libraries:flask, jsonpickle, numpy, cv2, validators, json, requests, Response.
please run the testing_examples.py to see a few examples and how the api key is requested and sending the images.
Ideally you store your api-key in a Database but with the restriction of only one py file for assessment I implemented this way.
